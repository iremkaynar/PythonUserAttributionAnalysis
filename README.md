# PythonUserAttributionAnalysis
This project aims to fetch user data via JSON, analyze this data, and perform matching between users based on similar interests. Additionally, it aims to efficiently match interests by organizing user data with hash tables, utilizing search algorithms, and gaining experience in data structures, graph theory, hash tables, search algorithms, data analysis, and relationship management. It aims to enhance problem-solving and analytical thinking skills by practicing both data structures, algorithms, and real data analysis with relational inferences. It benefits from improving both theoretical knowledge of data structures/algorithms and practical skills in data analysis and relational deductions.
